# Calcite-Bootstrap


Calcite-Bootstrap is a UI kit for Bootstrap 3.x. At this time is is intended for use building Esri branded applications, but there are plans to open this up further.

# Using Calcite Bootstrap

There are two main ways to use Calcite Boostrap: copying compiled css files into your project or installing via a package manager and using a SASS build step in your project.

## Static Files

This is probably the easiest way. If you're looking to get up and running quickly, just [download the latest release](https://github.com/esri/calcite-bootstrap/releases) and move the zipped files to wherever you keep you assets. Be sure to use [the documentation site](http://esri.github.io/calcite-bootstrap/) and the main [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to copy and paste patterns, components, and even a sample html boilerplate.

## NPM

To install Calcite Bootstrap with npm, type:

```
npm install --save-dev Esri/calcite-bootstrap#v0.2.5
```

You must add the current version in order to get the `dist/` folder.

If you're using sass, be sure to add `node_modules/calcite-bootstrap/dist/sass/` to your load path. If you're using `grunt-contrib-sass` you add that like this:

```
'sass': {
  target: {
    options: {
      loadPath: 'node_modules/calcite-bootstrap/dist/sass/'
    },
    files: {
      'path/to.css': 'path/to.scss'
    }
  }
}
```

Then in your main `.scss` file, you can just require the framework: `@import "calcite-bootstrap";`.

## Calcite Boostrap vs. Calcite Web

Calcite Bootstrap aims to provide a robust set of patterns and utilities for the developer building general purpose web applications, while simultaneously carrying forward the Calcite-Web asthetic.


# Build and Deploy Process

## Building Documentation
The docs are hosted on gh-pages and can be deployed by anyone with push access to the repo.

`grunt deploy` will build the doc pages, and the css, an push that to gh-pages

## Deploy Releases
Releases are stored @ github, and the deploy process involves a shell-script

`sh ./bin/release.sh`

# Contributing to Calcite Bootstrap

Installing Calcite Bootstrap was designed to be fairly painless. If you have any problems, be sure to [submit an issue](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-bootstrap/issues/).

## Where to Find Contributors
Contributors communicate on the Slack [ESRI Patterns Team](https://esri-patterns.slack.com/) in the #calcite-bootstrap channel.

### Install Dependencies

Calcite Boostrap has these main dependencies. 

- Xcode Command Line Tools (for Git)
- Node.js
- Grunt
- Bower
- Sass

1. Open Terminal (or your favorite command line tool. For OSX, I recommend iTerm) and check to see if you have Git installed just by entering `$ git`. You should see a list of commands for git if it is. If Git is not installed, OSX will automatically prompt you to install the XCode Command Line Developers Tools. Follow the prompts to complete the install.
2. Visit [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) to install Node. Check the install by entering `$ node -v` in Terminal
3. Install Grunt by entering `$ npm install -g grunt-cli` in Terminal.
4. Install Bower by entering `$ npm install -g bower` in Terminal.
5. Install SASS by entering `$ gem install sass` in Terminal.

If you run into errors during the installs, Mac Users my want to try using `sudo`. For example:

`$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli` or `$ sudo gem install sass`

### Fork the Repository

All the code for Calcite Bootstrap lives [on GitHub](https://github.com/ArcGIS/calcite-bootstrap). We use the [fork and pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to manage contribution.

1. Fork the repository so you have your own copy (`$ your-username/calcite-bootstrap`)
2. Clone the repo locally with `$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/calcite-bootstrap`
3. Move into the clone repo:  `$ cd calcite-bootstrap`

### Setting up the Repository

1. Install npm modules: `$ npm install`
2. Install bower components: `$ bower install`

Again, if you run into errors during, Mac Users my want to try using `sudo`.

When the installs complete run `$ grunt` to start the application. Open a new browser and navigate to http://localhost:9000.

### Git Remote
You should also add `Esri/calcite-bootstrap` as a remote at this point. We generally call this remote branch 'upstream':

```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Esri/calcite-bootstrap
```

Check your configuration: `$ git remote -v`

The results should look like:
```
origin	https://github.com/your-username/calcite-bootstrap.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/your-username/calcite-bootstrap.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/Esri/calcite-bootstrap.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/Esri/calcite-bootstrap.git (push)
```

## Troubleshooting

When running `$ bower install` if you get an error stating `unable to connect to gihub.com` you will need to run the following command: `git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://`

If the above doesn't work, try manually modifying the `.git-config` file under your user directory (note: it is a hidden file).

```
[url "https://"]
	insteadOf = git://
```
[link to stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27417175/bower-install-libraries-issues)

You might also want to try installing `sudo npm install -g n` and `sudo npm install -g nvm`

## Development

To run a development environment, just type `$ grunt`. You should have a copy of the documentation site live at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

### Common Tasks

- `$ grunt` - [default] builds and then serves up local environment at localhost:9000 (includes watch for updated files)
- `$ grunt serve` - serves local environment at localhost:9000 (no build)
- `$ grunt build` - builds local environment only (no localhost)
- `$ grunt release` - creates `calcite-bootstrap.zip` file for release in root directory 
- `$ grunt publish` - publishes new release candidate to Amazon S3 (requires credentials)

## Doing the git dance

Please use the practice of creating a new branch for the the task you are working on

`$ git checkout -b calcite-buttons`

Once you are ready to commit, push the changes to your fork.

`$ git push origin calcite-buttons`

Then go to the main repo page and click the button to create a Pull Request.
